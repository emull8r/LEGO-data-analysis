# LEGO-data-analysis
Data analysis of the Rebrickable database circa July 2017 that was done for the Summer 2024 offering of ODU CS 624: Data Analytics and Big Data.

Analyzethisbrick.ipynb was created as a group effort by Evan Mulloy, Kenny Bush, and Gregory Bacon.

Evan focused on analyzing the colors of LEGO pieces, using Gregory's idea to convert hex values to HSV to analyze by hue, saturation, and value. Kenny focused on analyzing sets and Gregory focused on analyzing themes.
