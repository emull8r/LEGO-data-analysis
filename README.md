# LEGO-data-analysis
Data analysis of the Rebrickable database circa July 2017 that was done for the Summer 2024 offering of ODU CS 624: Data Analytics and Big Data.

Database provided by Rachael Tatman and Rebrickable: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/lego-database

Analyzethisbrick.ipynb was created as a group effort from the following contributers:
Evan Mulloy
Kenny Bush
Gregory Bacon

Evan Mulloy's contributions focused on the colors of LEGO pieces, using Gregory Bacon's suggestion of converting RGB colors to HSV for analysis.
